I'm Derek and I do Software Development. I primarily work with web technologies, building Single Page Applications with Angular on the frontend and Python or node on the backend. I love programming of all kinds, but I'm usually most interested in Web Development, Game Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Reverse Engineering binary stuff!
