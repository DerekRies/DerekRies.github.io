### How I Got Into Programming

I first got interested in coding when I was 12 thanks to an online game called **Neopets** that let you customize your pet's pages with HTML & CSS. Then I started getting into programming maybe a year or two later due to another game, **RuneScape**. This time around my friends and I would program little macro GUIs so we could spam our messages in chat

It wasn't until I started doing graphic design that I realized I should be programming though. So after i took my first JavaScript class doing my Web Design & Interactive Media degree I started teaching myself programming and computer science with websites like [Coursera.org](https://coursera.org) and [Udacity.com](https://udacity.com).
