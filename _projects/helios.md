## Another Space App

Helios is a web app devoted to visualizing all currently discovered confirmed and candidate exoplanets in a beautiful and realistic 3d simulation. Helios aims to educate individuals of all ages about some of the most important and thought provoking research in Astronomy, finding new worlds like our own. It does so by exposing the individual to:

 - The diversity of exoplanets and exoplanetary systems
 - Demonstrating the processes by which these planets are discovered
 - Providing a sandbox to promote exploration and construction of your own systems under the mechanics that govern our universe.

Helios is a hackathon project built in 48 hours, essentially just trying to make my old project [XOPL]({{site.url}}/projects/xopl.html) over again but with a different, prettier interface. The stars graphics have been changed, the planets have a texture, and the code is much prettier!
